        <p>People have been benefitting from yoga for over 2,000 years & it has become very popular in the west in recent times.  It is more than just a physical 'work-out', it is a philosophical approach to life which helps to achieve more clarity, greater awareness & a calmer mind.</p>
        <p>A yoga practice uses a rhythmical breathing technique that revitalises the body & rejuvenates the mind.</p>
        <p>The benefits of a regular yoga practice are that it builds on flexibility, balance, concentration, clarity, endurance as well as greatly reducing stress levels.
        It keeps the joints loose & mobile as well as maintaining & building strong muscles.
        It tones & massages the internal organs & glands & boosts the blood circulation.</p>
        <p>There are many ways to explain what yoga is, so here are some of the examples:</p>

            <h4>Patanjali’s definition of yoga</h4>
            <p>The great sage Patanjali, in the system of Raja Yoga, gave one of the best definitions of yoga. He said, ‘Yoga is the blocking (nirodha) of mental modifications (chitta vritti) so that the seer (drashta) re-identifies with the (higher) Self. Patanjali’s system has come to be the epitome of Classical Yoga Philosophy and is one of the 6 or 7 major philosophies of India.</p>

            <h4>Day-to-day meaning of yoga</h4>
            <p>At its most practical level yoga is a process of becoming more aware of who we are. Yoga techniques facilitate balance and health, and unfold our dormant potential. Yoga allows us to be more aware of ourselves and feel connected.  As such, yoga is a process of self-discovery. This leads us to self-mastery and self-realization.</p>

            <h4>Yoga as a science</h4>
            <p>Yoga is a science, that is, it is a body of techniques that lead us to consciously connect with ourselves and with life, the experience of yoga. As yoga is a science, there is no dogma or belief system attached to it. Yoga simply tells us to do a certain practice and then to feel the effect of that practice, e.g. if we breath slowly in a relaxed manner we will slow our heart rate; if we focus the mind we will develop mental peace and deep insight.</p>

        <h3>Types of Yoga</h3>
        <p>No experience is required as our classes are suitable for all levels. There will always be classes of mixed abilities & those more experienced will be provided with advanced options within poses where appropriate.</p>

            <h4>Ashtanga Yoga</h4>
            <p>In Sanskrit Ashtanga is translated as "Eight Limb path." Ashtanga yoga involves a very physically demanding sequence of postures, so this style of yoga is definitely not for the beginner. It takes an experienced yogi to really love it. Ashtanga starts with five sun salutation A's and five sun salutation B's and then moves into a series of standing and floor postures. In Mysore, India, people gather to practice this form of yoga together at their own pace—if you see Mysore-led Ashtanga, it's expected of you to know the series. Vinyasa yoga stems from Ashtanga as the flowing style linking breath to movement.</p>

            <h4>Iyengar Yoga</h4>
            <p>Iyengar yoga was founded by B.K.S. Iyengar and focuses on alignment as well as detailed and precise movements. In an Iyengar class, students perform a variety of postures while controlling the breath. Generally, poses are held for a long time while adjusting the minutiae of the pose. Iyengar relies heavily on props to help students perfect their form and go deeper into poses in a safe manner. Although you won’t jump around, you will definitely get a workout and feel incredibly open and relaxed after an Iyengar class. This style is really great for people with injuries who need to work slowly and methodically.</p>

            <h4>Hatha Yoga</h4>
            <p>The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. In the West, hatha yoga simply refers to all the other styles of yoga (Ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are grounded in a physical practice. However, there are other branches of yoga such as kriya, raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the physical-based yoga practice. The physical-based yoga is the most popular and has numerous styles. Hatha yoga classes are best for beginners since they are usually paced slower than other yoga styles. Hatha classes today are a classic approach to breathing and exercises. If you are brand-new to yoga, hatha yoga is a great entry point to the practice.</p>

            <h4>Yoga Flow/Vinyasa Yoga</h4>
            <p>Vinyasa means "to place in a special way" and in this case yoga postures. Vinyasa is the most athletic yoga style. Vinyasa was adapted from Ashtanga yoga in the 1980s. In Vinyasa classes, the movement is coordinated with your breath and movement to flow from one pose to another. Many types of yoga can also be considered Vinyasa flows such as Ashtanga, power yoga, and prana. Vinyasa styles can vary depending on the teacher, and there can be many different types of poses in different sequences. I personally teach an alignment-based style of vinyasa and choreograph new flows every time, but I also like to hold some of the poses a bit longer after warming up.</p>
